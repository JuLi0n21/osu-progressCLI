## TODOs (no prioritys)

- Add possiblity to reload api data incase no internet (or beatmap changed)  (automatic or manual)
- localbeatmap parser (offline, not submitted maps support) (use osu-tools)
- highconfigurable website (showing what graphs u want and what not)
- page for a single score
- api endpoint for search functionaliy
- make date picker work
- importer for [circle-tracker](https://github.com/FunOrange/circle-tracker)

## NOTES
- rate limite api calls incause i ever make a importer (1 every 2 seconds) 
- change form .net 6.0 to somehting lower (to not have people install dependencys) (could nbot work cause osu tools is net6)
